This is my personal blog for articles about me, stuff that I'm working on, and stuff that I think about.

I'm using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. It's been a bit of a pain to set up, mostly because I've been working in _Git Bash for Windows_ and _Windows Subsystem for Linux_,which are both a bit weird and don't have a completely sane Ruby.
