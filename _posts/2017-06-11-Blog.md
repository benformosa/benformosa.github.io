This is my personal blog for articles about me, stuff that I'm working on, and stuff that I think about.

I'm using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. It's been a bit of a pain to set up, mostly because I've been working in _Git Bash for Windows_ and _Windows Subsystem for Linux_,which are both a bit weird and don't have a completely sane Ruby.

In order to get it working, I had to:
* Remove `jekyll` and add `github-pages` gems.
* Run `bundle update`.
* Build the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

I also had to look at the layouts provided by GitHub's themes. `jekyll new` creates pages using `home` and `post` layouts. The theme I was using only provides `default`, so I needed to create my own page to create an index of posts.
